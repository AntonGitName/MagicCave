    <string name="task_text">The task of every level is simple. You are here to light all the candles! You can change the state of any candle but all of them are somehow connected to each other so changing state of only one candle will cause some of its neighbours to change their state too. Don\'t mess up and you will beat the puzzle!</string>
    <string name="modes_label">Game modes</string>
    <string name="modes_text">You can choose between two different modes: the cave mode and the random mode. In the first one you will have to solve puzzles from four different caves in order to get magic stars!=) In the second mode you will have a chance to try your best on a randomly generated puzzle. Be aware these puzzles might be not that simple to crack!</string>
    <string name="control_label">Controls</string>
    <string name="control_text">You can change a state of a candle by simply touching over it. If you get stack, you can press button *magic* and our super-duper algorithm will show you a few steps that will take you closer to a solution. You also can press menu button if you want to restart level or to get back to main menu.</string>
